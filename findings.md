## 📊 TOP 5 CRITICAL PREDICTORS OF CREDIT SALES

### 1. **GDP (Gross Domestic Product)** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
- **Correlation with Credit Sales:** +0.777 (VERY STRONG POSITIVE)
- **Impact Power:** ~77.7%
- **Average GDP:** 27,774 billion AZN
- **GDP Growth Trend:** +79.52% (2020-2025)
- **Average Quarterly Growth:** +3.25%

**Decision Insight:**
> When GDP is above median (30,014 mln AZN), credit sales are significantly higher. This is your #1 indicator for aggressive vs conservative credit strategy.

---

### 2. **Oil Price** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
- **Correlation with Credit Sales:** +0.764 (VERY STRONG POSITIVE)
- **Impact Power:** ~76.4%
- **Average Oil Price:** $12.74/barrel
- **Current Price Range:** $4.99 - $19.30/barrel
- **Volatility:** 26.7% (Moderate)

**Decision Insight:**
> Oil price is the #2 strongest predictor. When oil is in high zone (>$80/barrel), pursue aggressive credit sales. When in low zone (<$60/barrel), tighten risk management.

**Price Zones:**
- 🔴 **Low Risk Zone:** <$60/barrel - Conservative lending
- 🟡 **Moderate Zone:** $60-$80/barrel - Balanced approach
- 🟢 **High Opportunity Zone:** >$80/barrel - Aggressive sales

---

### 3. **Foreign Trade Turnover (Xarici ticarət dövriyyəsi)** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
- **Correlation with Credit Sales:** +0.752 (VERY STRONG POSITIVE)
- **Impact Power:** ~75.2%

**Decision Insight:**
> Strong export activity = strong credit demand. Monitor foreign trade data monthly.

---

### 4. **Export Volume (İxrac)** ⭐⭐⭐⭐
- **Correlation with Credit Sales:** +0.655 (STRONG POSITIVE)
- **Impact Power:** ~65.5%

---

### 5. **Money Supply (Pul bazası)** ⭐⭐⭐⭐
- **Correlation with Credit Sales:** +0.598 (STRONG POSITIVE)
- **Impact Power:** ~59.8%

---

## 🔴 CRITICAL RISK FACTOR: NPL (Non-Performing Loans)

### NPL Statistics (Latest Analysis)
- **Correlation with Credit Sales:** -0.604 (STRONG NEGATIVE) ⚠️
- **Average NPL:** 23.53 million AZN
- **NPL Range:** 13.57 - 42.22 million AZN
- **NPL Volatility:** 41.7% (High Risk)
- **Current Trend:** ↘️ Decreasing (Positive sign)

### **Key Finding:**
```
When NPL increases by 1 million AZN,
credit sales decrease proportionally.
```

**Decision Insight:**
> ⚠️ **PRIORITY #1:** NPL management is CRITICAL. High NPL directly suppresses new credit sales. Every 10% reduction in NPL can unlock significant credit sales growth.

**Action Thresholds:**
- **NPL < 18 mln AZN:** ✅ Green Light - Expand Credit
- **NPL 18-25 mln AZN:** 🟡 Caution - Maintain Balance
- **NPL > 25 mln AZN:** 🔴 Red Flag - Tighten Lending, Focus on Collection

- **Average:** 13.22%
- **Correlation with Credit Sales:** +0.411 (MODERATE POSITIVE)
- **Benchmark:** >12% is Good
- **Current Assessment:** ✅ Above benchmark (Good)

**Decision Insight:**
> Strong bank profitability (ROE, ROA) creates capacity for more lending. Monitor these monthly.

## 👥 CUSTOMER BASE DYNAMICS

### Customer Metrics
- **Average Customer Count:** 98,817
- **Customer Range:** 16,316 - 252,200
- **Customer Volatility:** 81.6% (VERY HIGH)
- **Correlation with Credit Sales:** +0.383 (MODERATE POSITIVE)

### **Critical Metric: Average Credit Per Customer**
- Monitor this ratio closely
- Declining ratio = need for cross-selling/upselling
- Increasing ratio = successful penetration

**Decision Insight:**
> Customer growth is necessary but not sufficient. Focus on both customer acquisition AND credit penetration per customer.

## 🔗 SYNERGISTIC EFFECTS

### Combined Impact: GDP + Oil Price
**Scenario Analysis:**

| Scenario | GDP Status | Oil Status | Avg Credit Sales | Performance |
|----------|-----------|------------|------------------|-------------|

| 🔴 **Both LOW** | Below Median | Below Median | **59,371 mln AZN** | Baseline |
| 🟡 **Mixed** | One High, One Low | One High, One Low | **77,757 mln AZN** | +30.9% vs baseline |

**Decision Insight:**
> **GOLDEN RULE:** When BOTH GDP and Oil are above median, this is your PRIME TIME for maximum credit sales push. Target 100,000+ mln AZN in credit sales.

## 🚨 RED FLAGS - IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

| Indicator | Threshold | Action |
|-----------|-----------|--------|
| **NPL** | >30 mln AZN | 🚨 STOP new lending, focus on collections |
| **Oil Price** | <$50/barrel | ⚠️ Switch to conservative strategy |
| **GDP Growth** | Negative for 2 quarters | ⚠️ Tighten credit standards immediately |
| **Credit Sales** | <60,000 mln AZN | 🔍 Emergency review of sales process |
| **NPL Growth** | >20% quarter-over-quarter | 🚨 Credit freeze, risk review |

## 💡 STRATEGIC INSIGHTS

### **Insight #1: Timing is Everything**
> The data shows that 73.7% higher credit sales are achievable when both GDP and Oil are high. Don't push equally hard in all quarters - CONCENTRATE efforts when macro conditions are favorable.

### **Insight #2: NPL is Your Bottleneck**
> With -0.604 correlation, NPL is the single biggest impediment to credit growth. Every AZN spent on NPL collection returns multiple AZN in new credit capacity.

### **Insight #3: Macroeconomic Dependency**
> 77.7% of credit sales variance is explained by GDP alone. You cannot fight macro trends - align your strategy with economic cycles.

### **Insight #4: Volume vs Quality Trade-off**
> High customer volatility (81.6%) suggests unstable customer base. Focus on QUALITY customers with high credit absorption, not just quantity.

## 📈 FORECASTING MODEL (Simple)

### **Next Quarter Credit Sales Forecast Formula:**

```
Expected Credit Sales = Base + (GDP Factor) + (Oil Factor) - (NPL Factor)

Where:
- Base = 80,612 mln AZN (historical average)
- GDP Factor = (Current GDP - Avg GDP) / Avg GDP × 80,612 × 0.777
- Oil Factor = (Current Oil - Avg Oil) / Avg Oil × 80,612 × 0.764
- NPL Factor = (Current NPL - Avg NPL) / Avg NPL × 80,612 × 0.604
```

### **Example Scenario:**
**If:**
- Current GDP = 32,000 billion AZN (+15% vs avg)
- Current Oil = $85/barrel (+567% vs avg of $12.74)
- Current NPL = 18 mln AZN (-24% vs avg)

**Then:** Credit sales forecast = **~95,000-105,000 mln AZN** (High opportunity quarter!)

---

## ✅ DECISION CHECKLIST FOR CREDIT SALES TARGETS

**Before Setting Quarterly Targets, Verify:**

- [ ] What is current GDP growth rate? (>3% = go aggressive)
- [ ] What is current oil price? (>$70 = favorable)
- [ ] What is current NPL level? (<20 mln = green light)
- [ ] What is ROE trend? (>12% = capacity exists)
- [ ] What is customer growth trend? (>0% = expanding base)
- [ ] Are we in economic expansion or contraction? (Expansion = push)

**Score:** 5-6 checks = Aggressive | 3-4 checks = Balanced | 0-2 checks = Conservative

---

## 📋 SUMMARY: THE GOLDEN RULES

1. **📈 Rule #1:** GDP and Oil Price are your north stars (correlations >0.75)
2. **🔴 Rule #2:** NPL above 25 mln AZN = stop and fix collections first
3. **⏰ Rule #3:** When GDP + Oil both high, TARGET 100,000+ mln AZN credits
4. **🎯 Rule #4:** Monitor these 3 metrics daily: Oil Price, NPL, Credit Applications
5. **🔄 Rule #5:** Review strategy monthly, not quarterly (macro changes fast)
